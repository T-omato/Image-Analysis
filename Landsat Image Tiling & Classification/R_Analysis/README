Tiling_functions.R are all the functions used to tile the landsat images.

The functions group together the following actions:

prepare_landsat_stack():

- Rasterizes the Landsat images, and removes verbose from names only leaving the "band" number
to make band calling easier. Sets up the working directory.

tiling_landsat():

- Tiles the previously rasterized landsat images into the specified squares 256, 512, 1024 px sizes.

setup_outputFolder():

- Sets up the output folder where the polygonized tiles will be saved for futur reference.

analyze_landsat_tiles():

- Creates and stores in the output folder the polygonized tiles. The final output images are
png images that show the barplot of the clustered k-means centers for the analyzed tile,
the newly polygonized tiles based on k-means centers, and the original vegetation indez tile that
was being analyzed. 

All of these functions will ultimately create a folder through which the user can choose
which tiles are best and easiest to classify in QGis for further ML training.
