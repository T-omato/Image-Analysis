Landsat Image Tiling & Classification

This project aims at obtaining landsat images, tiling them from their original size into 512 x 512 or larger sizes, and classifying them firstly
using k-means unsupervised classification, followed by adjusting the classifications with QGis, and finally feeding these classified tiles into
an ML algorithm.
