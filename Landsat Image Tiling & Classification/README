Landsat Image Tiling & Classification

This project aims at obtaining landsat images, tiling them from their original size into 512 x 512 or larger sizes, and classifying them firstly
using k-means unsupervised classification, followed by adjusting the classifications with QGis, and finally feeding these classified tiles into
an ML algorithm. 

Ultimately the goal is to train an ML algorithm to understand these images and use Landsat 8 images
to study the effects the Trump administration's policies will have on national forests.
