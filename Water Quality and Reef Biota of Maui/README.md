## Coastline Extraction, Masking & Distance Calculation
![Coastline Extraction, Masking & Distance Calculation](ImageAnalysis/Transition_Map.png)

Transition map of the coastline allows to visualize and calculate distances on water between study points. Here the cost map for the distance between Māʻalaea, and Kūʻau is shown on a colorized map of the island where the rgb channels correspond to bands #: r = "B5", g = "B4", b = "B3".
